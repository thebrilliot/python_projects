# Assorted Python Projects

Mainly learning projects composed of machine learning, web scraping, and other scripts.
Notably, I was able to train a machine learning model as a loan classifier with 99.6\% accuracy.
It is probably the most significant achievement in the collection, although I would hope to
classify loans and financial instruments in the future based on risk, rather than based on data
that is available ex-post facto.
